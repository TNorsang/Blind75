# Move Zeroes

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Using two pointer works well with a while loop.
If number is not 0 then swap it with left.
Goal is to move all non 0s to front of array.

Time Complexity : O(n) iterating through each element in input.
Space Complexity : O(1) No space is used.
