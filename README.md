# Leet Code 75 / Blind 75

These are set of questions that encompasses all the Data Structures and Algorithms that are often asked in interviews.

I have also added extra questions that I felt are good enough to be included for my personal references.

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity Overview

### Fastest -> Slowest:

O(1) → O(log n) → O(n) → O(n log n) → O(n²) → O(2ⁿ) → O(n!)

### Descriptions:

O(1): Constant Time — The operation takes the same amount of time, regardless of the input size.
O(log n): Logarithmic Time — The operation reduces the problem size exponentially with each step (e.g., binary search).
O(n): Linear Time — The operation's time grows directly in proportion to the input size.
O(n log n): Log-linear Time — A combination of linear and logarithmic time (common in efficient sorting algorithms like mergesort).
O(n²): Quadratic Time — Time grows as the square of the input size (common in algorithms with nested loops).
This is a specific case of polynomial time (where time grows as a power of the input size).
O(2ⁿ): Exponential Time — Time doubles with each increase in input size (e.g., recursive algorithms without memoization).
O(n!): Factorial Time — Time grows as the factorial of the input size (e.g., brute force algorithms for solving the traveling salesman problem).
